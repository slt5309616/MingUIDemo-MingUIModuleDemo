# MingUIDemo-MingUIModuleDemo
MingUIDemo(test.unity)&amp;MingUIModuleDemo(LiuJieScene.unity)
This project doesn't contain necessary asset files and shaders,because the size of those files are too big to upload. so the unity project may not be loaded. this is only for reading the code & run the built exe.
